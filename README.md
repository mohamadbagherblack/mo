i've recently started using godot and this is a very simple script for generating random positions in range of an area
i made this for my own project and noticed there is no such thing in asset store even tho its very simple

features:
include an area wich the random position will be generated in
exclude an area from generating

in order to get the random position you need to call the give_random_pos() function.
in order to enable exclude zone hit the bool in scene and set the pos1 and pos2

feel free to change update or do whatever you want
